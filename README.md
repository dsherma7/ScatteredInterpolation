To start this app, first download the code to your local machine using `git clone` or the download button. Then, the easiest way to start this is to navigate to this directory and run

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

which will run this program on your local machine at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. Although depending on your browser, it may suffice to simply run the `Index.html`.

Note: Chrome is highly recommended for this demo. Safari works ok.
